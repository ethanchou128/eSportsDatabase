## Justin's and Ethan's Final Project

This is an eSports Team database created in C++ which I had collaborated on with a partner whom is one of the contributors.

This database utilizes nCurses and allows the ability to store eSports teams and information such as their net worth, what 
games they have pro teams involved in, date of inception, among other things.

There is a makefile present in this repository, with the executable being "./test".
