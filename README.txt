Instructions for Compiling and Running
--------------------------------------

(put instructions here for compiling and running your program; hopefully it's
just to type "make" in the shell!)
Just type “make” in the shell once you are in the correct directory.
**The program will have the ncurses program ready to go, but an iostream program is also on standby in the case that ncurses does not work out properly.**
**The ncurses program is the start() function, the start_iostream() function is the iostream program.**

Limitations
-----------

We implemented all the known features except the find and delete by range features because given our records and numeric fields we provided the user to search by, we felt it was an unnecessary feature to implement.

We chose not to implement any find/delete feature with net worth because we felt net worth wasn’t something we thought was logical in a program like this. Also applying to the real world, we thought no one searches for eSports teams solely by net worth.


Known Bugs
----------

(list all known bugs here)
We don’t have any known bugs.

Extra Features
--------------

(if your program has any extra or special features, tell us about them here)
We do not have any additional features.
